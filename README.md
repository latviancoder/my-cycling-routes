Cycling routes app built with React (hooks), styled-components, Leaflet and d3.

The app is completely static. It uses GPX files exported from komoot.com as data source.

Parts of the app were developed on [stream](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9VFmmxpVTI) (sound is messed up first 15 min though).
